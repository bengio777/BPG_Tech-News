## Must-Read

- **[Anthropic Drops Hard Safety Limits From Responsible Scaling Policy v3.0](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-25/anthropic-adds-caveat-to-ai-safety-policy-in-race-against-rivals)** — Anthropic updated its Responsible Scaling Policy (effective Feb 24) to remove the hard cap that barred training more capable models without proven safety measures in place, citing a "zone of ambiguity," an anti-regulatory climate, and Pentagon pressure as the three forces making the original structure untenable. The new policy separates unconditional safety mitigations from broader industry recommendations, and adds mandatory Frontier Safety Roadmaps and Risk Reports published every 3-6 months as transparency offsets. *Source: Bloomberg*

AMD shares jumped over 10% on the news, which analysts read as a direct challenge to Nvidia's compute monopoly among hyperscalers. *Source: TechCrunch*
